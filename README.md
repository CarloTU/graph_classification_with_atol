# Graph classification with Automatic Topologically-Oriented Learning

The repo contains the giotto.ai version of the ATOL layer originally developped 
by Martin Royer et al. in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13472.pdf).

## Requisites
  * giotto-learn
  * scikit-learn
  * joblib
  * numpy
 
 ## Notebook
 The notebook contains an example of usage for the ATOL layer. It is applyied 
 to a graph classification problem and it reach good results, comparable to 
 state of the art algorithms. 
 
 ### Data
 The dataset we used in the notebook is taken from the original paper 
 and it is called REDDIT5K. It contains 5000 graphs labelled in 5 classes.
